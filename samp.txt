Title: famous book passages

book1:
It was the best of times,
it was the worst of times,
it was the age of wisdom,
it was the age of foolishness,
it was the epoch of belief,
it was the epoch of incredulity,
it was the season of Light, i
t was the season of Darkness,
it was the spring of hope,
it was the winter of despair.

book2:
The only people for me are the mad ones,
the ones who are mad to live,
mad to talk, mad to be saved,
desirous of everything at the same time,
the ones who never yawn or say a commonplace thing,
but burn, burn, burn like fabulous yellow roman candles
exploding like spiders across the stars.

book3:
This is the way the world ends
This is the way the world ends
This is the way the world ends
Not with a bang but a whimper
